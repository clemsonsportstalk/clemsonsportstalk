 <h2>Clemson Sports Talk Chatroom</h2>
 
<div class='pam'>
    We want the chat to be a pleasant and safe place for all chatters. The
    primary focus of this chat is content related to the live shows. Keeping that
    in mind, these are the rules:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      Keep chat conversation at a family friendly level, as there are a wide
      range of ages in our chat. Self-censorship of swearing is not considered
      "family friendly".
    </li>
    <li>
      No offensive references to a person or group by race, religion, gender,
      or orientation.
    </li>
    <li>
      PLEASE DON'T TYPE IN ALL CAPS.
    </li>
    <li>
      Do not harass other chatters. You can respectfully disagree.
    </li>
    <li>
      Do not repeat yourself over and over to try to get noticed, as this is
      disruptive to the chat.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    The most important (and simplest) rule: Use common sense, and don't be a jerk.
  </p>
