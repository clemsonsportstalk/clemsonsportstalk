      <p>
        Feel free to contact us at <a
        href='mailto:clemson81@gmail.com'>clemson81@gmail.com</a> if you have
        any interest in being a sponsor on our website or programs.
      </p>

      <p>
        We offer two distinct levels of advertising for our clients. We
        understand that advertising is important to your business and we want
        you to find the package that fits your needs.

      <p>
        The Clemson Sports Talk Packages are for companies who want to invest
        in radio advertising and also get the benefits we have to offer from an
        online perspective. However, we don't want to leave those smaller
        business owners out of the equation either. That's why we also offer
        our TigerNet Talk Packages.
      </p>

      <p>
        Advertising with Clemson Sports Talk can put your company in the eyes
        and ears of Clemson fans, as well as sports fans around the world. We
        also have one of the most influential Clemson Twitter feeds on the web.
        Placing an advertisement with Clemson Sports Talk will spread your
        company's advertisement around the globe.
      </p>

      <p>
        We look forward to creating a relationship with your company that can
        take your product line to the masses. Welcome to our team!
