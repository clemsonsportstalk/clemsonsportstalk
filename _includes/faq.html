  <strong>Can I still be a part of the show if I listen to the podcast version?</strong>
  <br>
  You know it! We won't leave anyone out of the discussions. You can
  participate in the program 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  The phone lines
  are always up and running. If you listen to the podcast version and you want
  your voice heard give us a call, tweet, or email.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>So how do I call in when the show isn't on?</strong>
  <br>
  Unfortunately on Fox Sports Radio 1400 you would be calling a different show, but the
  TigerNet Talk phone line is always up and running. You can also click on
  &quot;Send Voicemail&quot; on the front page. If you want your opinion heard
  give us a call!
