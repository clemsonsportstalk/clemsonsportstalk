        Lawton Swann has been
        involved in podcasting Clemson Tiger sports since 2004. In the fall of '04
        Lawton created the original Clemson sports podcast, TigerNet Talk. As far as we
        can tell, it was the first Clemson sports podcast in the world! Lawton didn't have any
        experience in the business, but he knew that he wanted to start something new for
        Tiger fans around the world. Ever since that first show, he has been hooked
        on talking about Clemson Tiger sports.

        It wasn't long before TigerNet Talk was receiving thousands of downloads
        per week. The show ran during football season, but Lawton always wanted to
        expand the coverage. In the fall of 2008, Lawton expanded the show to cover
        Clemson Tiger basketball in a segment called, &quot;Beyond the Arc&quot;.</p>
        
       <p>
        In the spring of 2008, Lawton was contacted by CRM sports to come on board with
        their program Clemson Hotline. Clemson Hotline was in it's infancy at that
        time, but Lawton jumped at the opportunity to be on the radio. Clemson Hotline
        originally ran on 1400 The Team in Columbia, but changed its flagship
        station in the fall of 2008 to the former 93.1 ESPN radio affiliate.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        In 2009 Clemson Hotline returned to 1400 The Team and added multiple
        affiliates around the state of South Carolina. The show could be heard around the entire state and
        the interest was beginning to grow.
      </p>
    
      <p>In 2012 El Swann Media made the decision to start broadcasting TigerNet Talk
         and Clemson Hotline LIVE on the internet for fans of our shows. After evaluating
         the different services available, Lawton felt <a href='http://www.vokle.com'>Vokle</a>
         met the needs of the program. Once debuting on Vokle, his shows climbed to #1 on the Staff
         Picks page. In late 2012 Vokle began experiencing issues and Lawton decided to move to
         <a href='http://www.spreecast.com'>Spreecast</a>. Since joining Spreecast, TigerNet Talk has made another quick rise in
         the rankings. Lawton's brand is often featured on Spreecast's front page.</p>

      <p>In the summer of 2013 Lawton's new show "Clemson Sports Talk" debuted on <a href='http://www.560theteam.com/main.html'>SportsRadio 560 The Team</a> July 15, 2013 at 6:00PM.
         The two hour show dedicated to Clemson Sports will is simulcast around the world on iHeart Radio. TigerNet Talk moved to
         Sunday nights at 9PM and merged with Clemson Hotline.</p>
    
          <p>Lawton's guest list includes former Tigers DeAndre Hopkins, Woody Dantzler, C.J. Spiller, 
        Da'Quan Bowers, Micheal Dean Perry, Perry Tuttle, Danny Ford, Bobby Bowden, and many more. Every Clemson player who
        joins the show goes through "The Clemson Ten". This is a unique set of questions that Lawton asks former players.
        The show also includes national and local guests such as, Tim Brando, Mark Packer, David Hood, Aaron Brenner,
        David Glenn, and others.

      <p>In January 2014, in a partnership with <a href='http://www.ismartmobilemarketing.com'>iSmart Mobile Marketing</a>, the Clemson Sports Talk Application was released for <a href='http://www.tinyurl.com/CSTiPhone'>iPhones, iPads,</a> and <a href='http://www.tinyurl.com/CSTAndroid'>Android</a> operating systems.
      It is an exciting time for Lawton and he hopes you will join him on this amazing ride. "I couldn't do it without you all."</p>
      <p>On March 16, 2014 The State ran an article featuring Clemson Sports Talk titled <a href='https://scontent-a-iad.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/t31.0-8/1614025_10153952999705089_2081777608_o.jpg'><i>"All Clemson, (Almost) All The Time"</i></a> written by Bob Gillespie.
    On July 15, 2014 Clemson Sports Talk celebrated it's first year on the airwaves in Columbia. The First Annual "Swanny Awards" were given out on air. The full show can be heard here. <iframe width="660" height="180" src="//www.mixcloud.com/widget/iframe/?feed=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mixcloud.com%2FClemsonSportsTalk%2Fclemson-sports-talk-one-year-anniversary-show-7-15-14%2F&amp;embed_uuid=6bf6eea8-523b-42af-8c7d-3df63839e29e&amp;replace=0&amp;hide_cover=1&amp;embed_type=widget_standard&amp;hide_tracklist=1" frameborder="0"></iframe><div style="clear: both; height: 3px; width: 652px;"></div><p style="display: block; font-size: 11px; font-family: 'Open Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 0px; padding: 3px 4px; color: rgb(153, 153, 153); width: 652px;"><a href="http://www.mixcloud.com/ClemsonSportsTalk/clemson-sports-talk-one-year-anniversary-show-7-15-14/?utm_source=widget&amp;amp;utm_medium=web&amp;amp;utm_campaign=base_links&amp;amp;utm_term=resource_link" target="_blank" style="color:#808080; font-weight:bold;">Clemson Sports Talk - One Year Anniversary Show - 7-15-14</a><span> by </span><a href="http://www.mixcloud.com/ClemsonSportsTalk/?utm_source=widget&amp;amp;utm_medium=web&amp;amp;utm_campaign=base_links&amp;amp;utm_term=profile_link" target="_blank" style="color:#808080; font-weight:bold;">Clemson Sports Talk</a><span> on </span><a href="http://www.mixcloud.com/?utm_source=widget&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=base_links&amp;utm_term=homepage_link" target="_blank" style="color:#808080; font-weight:bold;"> Mixcloud</a></p><div style="clear: both; height: 3px; width: 652px;"></div>
