    <h2>Clemson Sports Talk History</h2>
     
      <p>
        The goal of this site is to offer informative Clemson sports talk as well as
        links to Clemson sports news from around the web. The information found on the
        Clemson News section is updated multiple times daily via our
        <a href='http://twitter.com/clemsonsports'>twitter feed</a>.
        While our blog is updated frequently, we pride ourselves in bringing Clemson
        news to fans around the world as quickly as possible.</p>
      <p>
        I have been
        involved in podcasting Clemson Tiger sports since 2004. In the fall of '04
        I created the original Clemson sports podcast, TigerNet Talk. As far as I
        can tell, it was the first Clemson sports podcast! I didn't have any
        experience in the business, but I knew I wanted to start something new for
        Tiger fans around the world. Ever since that first show, I have been hooked
        on talking Clemson Tiger sports.

        It wasn't long before TigerNet Talk was receiving thousands of downloads
        per week. The show ran during football season, but I always wanted to
        expand the coverage. In the fall of 2008 I expanded the show to cover
        Clemson Tiger basketball in a segment called, &quot;Beyond the Arc&quot;.
        Guests such as former Tigers DeAndre Hopkins, Woody Dantzler, C.J. Spiller, 
        Da'Quan Bowers, Micheal Dean Perry, and Perry Tuttle have been through "The Clemson Ten". 
        Plus national and local guests include, Tim Brando, Mark Packer, David Hood, Aaron Brenner,
        and David Glenn have been featured on the show.

        In the spring of 2008 I was contacted by CRM sports to come on board with
        their program Clemson Hotline. Clemson Hotline was in it's infancy at that
        time, but I jumped at the opportunity to be on the radio. Clemson Hotline
        originally ran on 1400 The Team in Columbia, but changed its flagship
        station in the fall of 2008 to 93.1 ESPN radio.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2009 Clemson Hotline returned to 1400 The Team and  added multiple
        affiliates around the state of South Carolina. Many Tiger fans in South
        Carolina are in our listening area throughout the week. Check out our
        affiliates page for more information on finding our show on your radio
        dial. A podcast addition of both shows is also available in Itunes.
      </p>
      <p>In 2012 El Swann Media made the decision to start broadcasting TigerNet Talk
         and Clemson Hotline LIVE on the internet for fans of our shows. After evaluating
         the different services available, we felt like <a href='http://www.vokle.com'>Vokle</a>
         met our needs the best. Once debuting on Vokle, our shows  climbed to #1 on the Staff
         Picks page. In late 2012 Vokle began experiencing issues and we decided to move to
         <a href='http://www.spreecast.com'>Spreecast</a>. We have made another quick rise in
         the rankings are our shows are often featured on Spreecasts front page.</p>

      <p>In the summer of 2013 our new show "Clemson Sports Talk" debuted on <a href='http://www.560theteam.com/main.html'>SportsRadio 560 The Team</a> July 15, 2013 at 6:00PM.
         The two hour show dedicated to Clemson Sports will is simulcast on iHeart Radio. TigerNet Talk moved to
         Sunday nights at 9PM and merged with Clemson Hotline.</p>
      <p>In January 2014, in a partnership with <a href='http://www.ismartmobilemarketing.com'>iSmart Mobile Marketing</a>, we released the Clemson Sports Talk Application for <a href='http://www.tinyurl.com/CSTiPhone'>iPhones, iPads,</a> and <a href='http://www.tinyurl.com/CSTAndroid'>Android</a> operating systems.
      It is an exciting time for me and I hope you will join me on this amazing ride. I couldn't do it without you all.</p>
      <p>On March 16, 2014 The State ran an article featuring Clemson Sports Talk titled <a href='https://scontent-a-iad.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/t31.0-8/1614025_10153952999705089_2081777608_o.jpg'><i>"All Clemson, (Almost) All The Time"</i></a> written by Bob Gillespie.
