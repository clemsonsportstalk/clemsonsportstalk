<p> On November 24, 2012 Clemson will host South Carolina to put an end to the Gamecocks first three game winning streak in 40 years. Get your pitchfork ready! Celebrate Ben Tillman's pitchfork returning for the 2012 season.
<p> The History of the Pitchfork: &quot;They have the Chicken Curse, which was put upon them by Clemson's Ben &quot;Pitchfork&quot; Tillman, because the Legislature of South Carolina didn't want Clemson to exist. Tillman and Thomas Greene Clemson (among others) fought tooth and nail to create a land grant institution for the state's poor farmers. Because of Tillman's frustration over the Legislature's snub, he slammed a pitchfork into the ground of South Carolina's campus and declared them &quot;cursed.&quot;&quot;-ESPN
