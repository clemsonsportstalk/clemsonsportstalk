<p> The History of the Pitchfork: &quot;They have the Chicken Curse, which was put upon them by Clemson's Ben &quot;Pitchfork&quot; Tillman, because the Legislature of South Carolina didn't want Clemson to exist. Tillman and Thomas Greene Clemson (among others) fought tooth and nail to create a land grant institution for the state's poor farmers. Because of Tillman's frustration over the Legislature's snub, he slammed a pitchfork into the ground of South Carolina's campus and declared them &quot;cursed.&quot;&quot;-ESPN
