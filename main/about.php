			<h3>Clemson Podcasts History</h3>
			<p>
				The goal of this site is to offer informative Clemson sports talk as well as
				links to Clemson sports news from around the web. The information found on the
				Clemson News section is updated multiple times daily via our
				<a href="http://twitter.com/clemsonpodcasts">twitter feed</a>.
				While our blog is updated frequently, we pride ourselves in bringing Clemson
				news to fans around the world as quickly as possible.

				Although the Clemson Podcasts website was recently created, I have been
				involved in podcasting Clemson Tiger sports since 2004. In the fall of '04
				I created the original Clemson sports podcast, TigerNet Talk. As far as I
				can tell, it was the first Clemson sports podcast! I didn't have any
				experience in the business, but I knew I wanted to start something new for
				Tiger fans around the world. Ever since that first show, I have been hooked
				on talking Clemson Tiger sports.
			</p>
			<p>
				It wasn't long before TigerNet Talk was receiving thousands of downloads
				per week. The show ran during football season, but I always wanted to
				expand the coverage. In the fall of 2008 I expanded the show to cover
				Clemson Tiger basketball in a segment called, &quot;Beyond the Arc&quot;.
				Guests such as Dan Scott, Scott Rhymer, Greg Wallace, Daniel Alexander,
				Steve Guerry, and Lee Hanna have been featured on the show.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the spring of 2008 I was contacted by CRM sports to come on board with
				their program Clemson Hotline. Clemson Hotline was in it's infancy at that
				time, but I jumped at the opportunity to be on the radio. Clemson Hotline
				originally ran on 1400 The Team in Columbia, but changed its flagship
				station in the fall of '08 to 93.1 ESPN radio.
			</p>
			<p>
				In 2009 Clemson Hotline returned to 1400 The Team and  added multiple
				affiliates around the state of South Carolina. Many Tiger fans in South
				Carolina are in our listening area throughout the week. Check out our
				affiliates page for more information on finding our show on your radio
				dial. A podcast addition of both shows is also available in Itunes.			</p>
			<p>In 2012 El Swann Media made the decision to start broadcasting TigerNet Talk and Clemson Hotline LIVE on the internet for fans of the shows. After evaluating the different services available, we felt like <a href="www.vokle.com">Vokle</a> met our needs the best. Since debuting on Vokle, El Swann Media has climbed into the top ten and currently sits at #2 on the charts. </p>
