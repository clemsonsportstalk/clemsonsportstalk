Early indications are that the defensive ends death was caused by an enlarged heart. More news will come via our twitter feed. Clemson fans around the world mourn the loss of one of the best defensive ends in our history.

I took a moment to put together some images from the play that most Clemson fans will always remember of Gaines. His return of a botched Wake Forest field goal single handedly put Clemson back in the game. Here is a video and the image.

Our thoughts and prayers go out to his family and the entire Greenwood, SC community.
