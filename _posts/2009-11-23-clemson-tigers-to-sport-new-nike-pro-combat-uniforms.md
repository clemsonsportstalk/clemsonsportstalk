I don't normally get into all the uniform banter that gets tossed around throughout the season. However, when I got a look at the new Nike Pro Combat Uniforms that Clemson will wear against USC this weekend, I got interested. This uniforms are pretty cool looking to me. I don't know if we will sport them all year next season, but the marketing alone is worth Clemson wearing them.

That being said, I really liked the uniforms we have worn this season. I have enjoyed seeing the two large stripes running down the legs of the pants. It has been a nice return to the look of our older teams. It will be interesting to see how they look. The only thing that worries me is the shoes. I hope the guys get in a lot of practice in those. Changing shoes is never good.
