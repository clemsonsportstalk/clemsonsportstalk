Evan McKelvey --- Berkeley High School

**Height**: 6-1 Weight: 185

**Senior Season**: 5 INT, 142 Tackles, 8 PBU

**40 Yard Dash**: 4.52 - Top 5 in state in 110 hurdles

Tall, rangy kid that covers the field sideline to sideline.  Biggest plus is he plays very downhill.  While he covers the entire field passing - wise, his ability to support the run is what separates him from the rest.  He has a unique, natural ability to make tackles.  He is definitely not afraid of contact.   He has great insticts and football knowledge. I can see him fitting in well at free safety down the road.

Even though he weighs 185lbs, he may be too thin to make an early impact. He has some maturing to do physically, and once he gets on a workout program and meal plan, he will gain the necessary weight. In my opinion, he will need a red shirt year to add the needed weight to play at this level.

He is the third brother that will play at the collegiate level and has tremendous potential. McKelvey will most likely enroll in August, but could have to enroll later. At this point, McKelvey could end up being a nice lateÂ acquisition for the Clemson Tigers. I will update you later once everything is finalized.
