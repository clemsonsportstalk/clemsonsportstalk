One of my loyal listeners sent me this information and I wanted to share it with you all.

**A challenge has been issued for all Clemson & Carolina Fans**. The above young man was seriously injured in a Mt. bike accident (fractured skull followed by a major stroke) told he would never walk again Michael is fighting as best he can. He is a USC grad & big fan - I was blessed to be a Clemson man myself - **The Challenge is** - Go to any First Citizens Bank in the State & donate what you can & tell them you want the $ to go to The "Clemson" side of the Michael Jonas Benefit Fund or the "Carolina" side - we'll see just which fan base steps up.  If you don't have a dog in that fight you can still give to a 3rd "neutral" account. Results will be announced at the **Beef O'Brady's Breakfast Fund Raiser in Irmo, SC for Michael Oct. 13th** & broadcast on various radio shows. There is also a Facebook page - Michael Jonas Benefit Fund - with info & links on how to donate.
