As many of you know we are in the process of a complete re-branding. The name "Clemson Podcasts" just didn't describe our model any longer. We are in the process of becoming "Clemson Sports Talk" and most of the initial work is already in the mix. We have the web address and things are coming together.

I'd also like to announce that we have a new weekly contest The P.A.W. (Pick-A-Winner) Contest which features some notable Clemson alumni. This year the four participants are former Clemson Tigers Woodrow Dantzler, Patrick Sapp, Joe Bostic, and Clemson businessman Richard Davis.

Each week these four will pick the winners of five games I send them. I am also going to pick and the winner will be crowned as the Inaugural P.A.W. Champion. Until everything is up and running on [ClemsonSportsTalk.com](http://clemsonsportstalk.com) we will continue to keep up with the contest on our Wordpress blog.

### Week #1
