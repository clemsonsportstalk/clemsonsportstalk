The Tigers come into the game following an emotional win in the 76 Classic Sunday. While the Tigers showed great poise in Anaheim, there are areas in which they will need to improve should they expect to win tonight. This contest will have great inside matchups as Trevor Booker and company try to contend with 6-9 Forward Mike Davis and 7-1 Center Mike Tisdale, both averaging double figure points per game. Look for the junior Davis to play most of the game as he is clearly this team's interior leader averaging a double-double in points and rebounds.

Offensively, the Tigers must work the ball inside to draw fouls and create open shots from the perimeter for Potter, Smith, and Young.  The inside-out movement of the ball will be critical if the Tigers want to succeed in the half court offense. Trevor Booker, Tanner Smith, and David Potter have been leading the way for the Tigers on offense, all shooting over fifty percent from the field.

Illinois Guard Demetri McCamey will look to help his team break the Tiger press averaging six assists per game as well as a handful of points. Coach Purnell showed on Sunday he was willing to come out of the press but will continue to put pressure on teams with the half court trap. Littlejohn Coliseum will be alive once again as the Tigers face their toughest home game of the season thus far. Tune in to ESPN at 7:15 for full coverage.
