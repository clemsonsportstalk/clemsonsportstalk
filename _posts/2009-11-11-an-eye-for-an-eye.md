My take on the Andre Branch (#40) play against FSU this past weekend:

After watching this clip time and time again, I still don't see an obvious eye gouge. I don't think Branch was trying to hurt the Spurlock as much as he was hoping to keep him from getting to the ball. Andre clearly pulls Spurlock's helmet and facemask, but I am not 100% sold on an eye gouge. Spurlock doesn't seem to look like his eye was gouged either after he stands up.

Sure, it's not a squeaky clean play and I doubt any Clemson fans would like it if it was done to one of our own, but it's football people. It wasn't after the play and I am not convinced Andre knew for a fact that the ball wasn't under the FSU player.  It looked more like the camel clutch to me and given Willy Korn and Landon Walker's DX trip down the hill, maybe Andre was just giving his best Iron Sheik impersonation.
