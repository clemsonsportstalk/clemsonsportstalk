No one should question Spiller's decision to return to Clemson for his senior season, which he ended as the 2009 Atlantic Coast Conference Player of the Year and amassed a total of 2508 yards from scrimmage on 264 touches - an astonishing 9.5 yards every time he touched the football.  Perhaps the most impressive statistic for Spiller's final season was his average of 270 yards-per-game in Clemson's four games against top-15 opponents.   Considering his lingering injuries throughout the 2009 season, his numbers appear even more impressive.  A nagging turf toe injury hampered his play during the entire season, yet he continued to impress every week which allowed him to finish sixth place in the Heisman Trophy voting.

With his recent selection at the number nine overall pick in the 2010 NFL draft by the Buffalo Bills, Spiller now steps into a situation where he may find early struggles.   Given the lack of talent surrounding him, the former Clemson star will have to work even harder to shed the Bush comparison and strive to produce like another similar NFL running back in Chris Johnson of the Tennessee Titans.  Much like Johnson had coming into the NFL, Spiller has question marks regarding his ability to become a workhorse back that can provide production between the tackles on a consistent basis.  Luckily for him, Spiller will soon have his shot to prove the doubters wrong and show that he is more than just the new Reggie Bush.
