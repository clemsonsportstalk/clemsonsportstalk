Over the past few years, Clemson has been criticized for their lack of quality opponents in November even though they play quality opponents throughout the ACC during the regular season. The 76 Classic gave the Tigers a chance to make their statement on a national level and they succeeded. They proved that they could compete on a high level, with teams outside of the ACC. Although there were growing pains for this young team, the Tigers bounced back with back to back wins against Long Beach State and a Butler program ranked 10th. Demontez Stitt showed the type of poise the Tigers will have to have if they plan on being successful in March.

The Tigers now come back to their home site where they will host their final two out of conference games against Illinois and South Carolina. Check back tomorrow for a pre-game breakdown of what adjustments the Tigers must make if they want to keep their momentum from Anaheim. The Tigers and the Illini are set to tip off at 7:15 Wednesday evening. ESPN coverage is available.
