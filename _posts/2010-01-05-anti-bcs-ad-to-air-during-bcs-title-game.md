title: Anti-BCS Ad To Air During BCS Title Game

If you follow our programs, you know where I stand on this subject. I am completely against the concept of the BCS and its exclusion of teams from the championship game. I think the current system doesn't give the fans the great ending that is deserved each and every year.

Here is the Anti-BCS as that will air in some markets, followed by my ideas of a playoff system that would keep the bowl system and give us an 8 team playoff to decided the NCAA Championship. It's far from perfect, but it's a start.

Certainly, Texas and Alabama are possibly the best two teams in the country, but until there is a playoff I can't agree with the result. Part of the enjoyment of the NCAA basketball tourney is the upsets that occur. Part of the magic in March comes from teams you don't think can compete with the North Carolinas of the world, compete and many times win.

I don't think the bowls should be removed by any means. I think the bowls should continue and the four major bowls (Rose, Sugar, Orange, Fiesta) should be the only games played on New Years Day. The other bowls would be played before the New Year.

The 8 teams who are in the playoff would play on the Saturdays during December and then the two championship teams would be off until the NCAA Championship Game played on January 2nd each and every year. Did you realize that the National Champion in college football is the only NCAA sport that isn't awarded an actual NCAA title?

I think this new playoff system would make January 2nd almost as popular as Super Bowl Sunday. I can only hope we get an 8 team playoff in my life.
