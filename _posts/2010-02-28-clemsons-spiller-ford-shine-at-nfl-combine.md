Both former Tigers blew the doors off with sub 4.3 times. Spiller ran an unofficial 4.27  while which was later kicked up to a 4.37. Jacoby Ford managed a 4.28 in the 40 yard dash and his time stood. Ford's time tied him for the best wide receiver time in ten years.  No matter how you slice it, both were quite impressive today and you can't coach speed.

In the end, Spiller looks to have solidified himself as the number one running back headed into the draft, but of the two it was Ford who made large gains. Not only did he put down an amazing time in the 40 yard dash, he also showed steady hands during pass catching drills which as only boosted his stock.

Check out these two interviews with Spiller and Ford from the combine. Both former Clemson Tigers are featured on the front page of the [NFL.com](http://www.nfl.com).
