I don't know about you, but I can't wait for Dabo Swinney to secure the new coaching staff. I might be reading into the situation too much, but the longer these spots are open the harder they will be to fill. All the while, I think fans, coaches and recruits are growing more and more concerned about the direction of Clemson's program.

At Clemson, I think trying to hire a coach is sort of like trying to sell someone a used car. They might be looking for a good deal, but they are a bit skeptical about how long they will get with their investment. Let's face it, we are not selling a new Porsche, we are selling a used Camry.

When you look at the Marion Hobby situation, it's clear that is what he is thinking. Being secure at Duke is a lot more comfortable than possibly searching for another job next season. Losing his job is possible at Duke in a year, it's likely at Clemson if things don't turn around. Talk about having your football program not selling itself.

At this point, Monday couldn't get here sooner for me. I think all the decisions will be in. I'm crossing my fingers on that. I'm past being concerned about who the hire is going to be, it's the waiting and worrying about our image. Not that 6-7 seasons cast a brilliant light, but not filling these spots in a timely manner is beginning to look like a mess.

So far it's been like a soap opera trying to follow the news. A coach is coming! No he isn't. No wait, maybe he is. Now there is a new target. He is in town meeting with Dabo. Breaking news comes and goes each hour, but no one knows for sure. Personally, I think it hurts our image. Clemson looks lost and desperate.

It just seems that with all of the different reports out there, Clemson's football program comes across as being unappealing to potential coaches. Eventually that will trickle down to our recruits and with signing day around the corner the heat will be on. I'm hoping our recruits don't begin to see it the same way. The last thing we can afford is for this class to fall apart.

I'm not being naive, I understand that a head coach can't win for losing. If Coach Swinney had hired Chad Morris quickly, many or us, (probably me included) would have accused of not evaluating all of  his options. Coach Swinney has to make some great hires to secure himself more time at Clemson. It's an important decision.

I just gather that our rivals are laughing at how the whole situation is being handled. Not just by the staff, but how it's played out so far on websites and in forums. Maybe that doesn't matter to you, but I think we are digging a deeper hole right now. It's getting even harder for me to envision Clemson with Dabo Swinney as the head coach in 2012.
