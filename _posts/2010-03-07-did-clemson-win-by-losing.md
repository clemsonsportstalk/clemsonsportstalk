It's possible that losing at Wake Forest will actually help Clemson in the ACC Tournament. As nice as the bye would have been, falling to the sixth seed might work out better for the Tigers after it's all said and done. Instead resting Thursday and then most likely facing Wake Forest on Friday, Clemson will open with N.C. State and, if they win, will get to play Florida State in round two.

Plus both games are 9:00 tipoffs which should give Clemson ample time to recover. Remember the old days where the last game winner played in the first game on Friday? Talk about tired legs.

Recently, the Wolfpack have been playing well, winning three out of four, but Clemson has matchup advantages all over the court. N.C. State probably scares me less than any other team in the league.

These two went to the wire in a 73-70 Clemson win in January, but Clemson didn't play their best game. I would expect the Tigers to win this game by at least ten points on a neutral floor. Clemson is the superior ball club and should show it on Thursday evening.

If that happens, Clemson would try to move to 3-0 against Florida State. Although it's always tough to beat someone three times in one season, I like Clemson's chances to get to the semifinals better in this scenario than if they had to face Wake Forest in round two, even with a bye. Give me FSU over Al-Farouq Aminu and Ish Smith any day of the week.

No matter what, the best draw was not being on Duke's side of the bracket. I think Clemson has has good a chance as any on their side. I could see a nice run by Clemson getting them into the semi-finals or finals. It's obvious the ACC is a very balanced league. Clemson's drop in the last game of the season, falling from #3 to #6 says it all.

Also, don't count out North Carolina. The Tarheels could easily make a run at the championship game this year. They have a good opening draw against Georgia Tech and even at the 10 seed have to be considered a threat. They have played awful this year, but they have the talent. If it clicks this weekend, the hated Tarheels could shock the Atlantic Coast Conference.

With all that said here are my predictions on how the ACC Tournament will play out.

**Round 1**

* #9 Virgina over #8 Boston College
* #5 Wake Forest over #12 Miami
* #10 North Carolina over #7 Georgia Tech
* #6 Clemson over #11 N.C. State

**Round 2**

* #1 Duke over #9 Virginia
* #5 Wake Forest over #4 Virginia Tech
* #2 Maryand over #10 North Carolina
* #6 Clemson over #3 Florida State

**Semi-finals**

* #1 Duke over #5 Wake Forest
* #6 Clemson over #2 Maryland

**Championship**

* #1 Duke over #6 Clemson

Yep, I'm going to put it out there right now. Clemson makes a run in the ACC Tournament and falls short, under tired legs, in a tough loss to the Blue Devils in the ACC Championship Game. I've struggled all year to be confident in this team, but their draw looks good to me. I guess we will see how it all plays out.

On to the ACC and NCAA Tournaments!

Don't you just love this time of the year?
