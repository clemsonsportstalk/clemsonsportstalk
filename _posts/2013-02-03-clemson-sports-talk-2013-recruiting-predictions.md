Obviously there is no rhyme or reason to college football recruiting. My stance on the effects that Twitter and Facebook have had on the process is well known. If you are an avid listener to my programs you also know I favor an early signing period to eliminate some of the youthful nonsense that we are having to deal with in this day in age.

The irony of it all is that I can clearly understand a player taking advantage of the situation. I also think for some it has more to do with establishing their brand and gaining Twitter followers than it does making a decision. Look, if I can add Twitter followers by declaring my "commitment" then why not shop around a while. By the way, follow us on Twitter [@ClemsonSports](http://twitter.com/clemsonsports). Yes, that was a shameless plug.

This week, I will have a chance to sit down with **ESPN's National Recruiting Director Tom Luginbill**. I plan to get his take on many of the issues that I see around college football recruiting  Plus, I will attempt to get his latest predictions for some of Clemson's top targets. Due to the Super Bowl, the show will air on Monday afternoon at 4:30.

Anyhow, on to my predictions for five of Clemson's top remaining targets.

**Adrian Baker** -- 6'1" 170, Cornerback -- **Clemson**

Outside of Alexander, I think Baker is the biggest toss up. He's down to Clemson and Oklahoma so anything could happen. I think in the end, distance and need will be the deciding factor.

![Tyrone Crowder](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRJgtMJqGtaRx2BUeZh5f4xzWGwEBLugelYcEc5L7IIMmOkxBLa)

**Tyrone Crowder** -- 6'1" 330, Offensive Guard -- **Clemson**

I've had a great feeling about Crowder for some time. He is a young man who keeps things fairly close to the vest, but my hunch here is that he will be headed to Tiger Town.

![Carl Lawson](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcR19QKpKs672WQQNg1KlKiTa-OgnNWeCiDMcbeoTGgirXGRYncQ-w)

**Carl Lawson** -- 6'2" 253, Defensive End -- **Tennessee**

What a get Carl Lawson could have been following the Robert Nkemdiche saga that occurred. Lawson who is an Auburn commit is down to three schools including Clemson. However, weeks ago it was Ryan Jenkins recruiting him to Clemson, now Jenkins is a Tennessee commit and trying to lure him that direction. Plus,  his relationship with former Auburn coach Tommy Thigpen who is now at Tennessee has me thinking he becomes a Vol.

![MacKensie Alexander](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTHdaZZQc-UO11V58wL86q8nCEmQp4LAB3f_vexbMid2B1nHIkc-g)

**MacKensie Alexander** -- 5'11 175, Cornerback -- **Clemson**

When the news broke that a package deal for the Alexander's wasn't a necessity I got a bit more excited about Clemson's hopes of landing the elite corner. Twin brother Mackenro all but threw Clemson under the bus for how they have handled his recruitment, or lack there of. I noted on a recent show that I hoped MacKensie would realize that this decision isn't about his brother, it's about MacKensie. This one will shock some people but Dabo Swinney has been a master. I'll take Clemson as early playing time should be available.

![Montravious Adams](http://alt.coxnewsweb.com/cnishared/tools/shared/mediahub/08/23/00/slideshow_1002381751_081912_Super11_13.jpg)

**Montravious Adams** -- 6'3" 290, Defensive Tackle -- **Clemson**

"Big Mon" or "Mount Adams" as many call him is one of, if not THE prize of this recruiting class. Alabama has proven that you win in the trenches and that is where Adams thrives. He is a huge kid who plays with a high motor. He has all the tools you would want to see in a player at his position this early in his football career. He is strong, fast off the line, and eats up space. Clemson has worked hard on Montravious and if Clemson is lucky enough to also land Carl Lawson the Nkemdiche hangover will vanish quickly.

As for **Robert Nkemdiche**, my prediction is **Ole Miss**. My contacts down there have been confident from the moment he decommitted from Clemson. In fact, one source there told me, "We were never worried about his commitment to Clemson."  However, they have also felt the commitment was coming and months have passed with no commitment. Does that mean anything?

Obviously Hugh Freeze is doing an outstanding job recruiting. Message boards will scream that it's "all about the Benjamins". I'm not here to throw stones. Heck, Clemson has been in the mix with many of the top players in the country and I think it's all been done on the up and up.  Sometimes you get fortunate and land a great class. Ole Miss was due and Coach Freeze has brought some excitement to the Rebels. Sometimes great classes pan out, sometimes they don't. Only time will tell. Eyes are certain to be on The Grove as Hotty Toddy is reeling in some big fish.

Finally, would I fall out my chair if Nkemdiche and Dabo agreed to a silent commit? No. Okay, maybe. The pressure was mounting on Robert from all angles and he needed a release. Perhaps Dabo and Robert made a deal. We back off, you stay committed, and go have fun as the number one recruit in America.

Perhaps the reason you don't hear much about Clemson is because Clemson doesn't want to be heard about. Could Dabo pull off the biggest shocker we've seen in a long time? Some will say that I am crazy, but funnier things have happened. I wouldn't bet my house, or even my favorite pet, but nonetheless February 6th should be fun.
