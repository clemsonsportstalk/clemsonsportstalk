Looking at this graphic, it shouldn't take you long to figure out why Clemson was unable to beat the Duke Blue Devils at home tonight. Outside of Trevor Booker, no one else showed up to play. Lots and lots of zeros in the shots made column for Clemson. One of the worst offensive games in Oliver Purnell's history. Credit Duke though, those guys pressured and contested everything. They might be slow, but those guys hustle.

Clemson (15-5, 3-3) travels to Boston College on Tuesday for what has now become a must win for Clemson. The ACC is a league where it is tough to win on the road and Clemson can't afford to give a winnable one away.
