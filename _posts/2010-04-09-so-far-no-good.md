As far as I can tell the coaching search at Clemson doesn't seem to be a high priority. Look, Terry Don is out there looking, but he is looking in all the wrong places. I thought it was bad when Al Skinner's name was mentioned, but add to that the likes of Herb Sendek and this thing is beginning to be a joke. Clemson basketball will not be respected if you name either of these two, or anyone else with their lack of coaching skill to the head spot.

I understand that Clemson isn't the most appealing basketball job in the Atlantic Coast Conference, but this is supposed to be a national search. Clemson should be a university that is willing to step up financially and get coach who can take our program to the next level. Sadly, that is not the case.

If all the names that have come out as being interviewed are correct, we might as well destroy Littlejohn and rebuild it and the program from the ground up. I hate that it appears so little is being done to make our program better. It's going to be a tough sell if you have to rely on the scraps from other schools.

Clemson needs to take a top level coach from a top level school and pay the money to get it done. I assure you that if we don't make a big hire the fan support will dwindle. At this hour, in my opinion, the Clemson University Athletic Director doesn't appear to be interviewing coaches who can build on Oliver Purnell's foundation. Isn't that what we were told would happen a few days ago?

I challenge the Athletic Department and Clemson University to put their money where their mouth is. Clemson fans deserve to have a respectable basketball program. Oliver Purnell had us on the cusp of being a solid team year in and year out. We need a coach who can take it to the next level. Clemson should be a program that can challenge for the ACC title and compete in the NCAA tournament.

So far, the interview list is no good.
