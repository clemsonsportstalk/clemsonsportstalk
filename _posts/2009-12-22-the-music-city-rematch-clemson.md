For the past few seasons Clemson fans heard about how close their team was to playing in the ACC Championship game. This year Clemson achieved that goal, but still fell short of their first ever BCS bowl birth. A year that brought so much excitement appears to be ending on a sour note for many Clemson fans. Losses to South Carolina and Georgia Tech brought the most confident among us crashing to the ground. This season reminds me of 2006 in more ways than one. High mid-season hopes, late season losses, Music City Bowl against Kentucky, ugh.

However unlike 2006, this Tiger squad can still close this season with a win, but it will not be easy. Kentucky is probably a better team than most people would like to believe. While (7-5, 3-5) isn't impressive, two of their losses were to Florida and Alabama. The others three were close conference losses and had they beaten Tennessee in the season finale (which went to overtime) Kentucky would have finished second in the SEC East. I agree with you, the SEC East is down, but still. **KENTUCKY** almost finished above Tennessee and Georgia this year!

Coming into that 2006 Music City Bowl, Kentucky hadn't won a bowl game in 22 years. Obviously that didn't stop the Wildcats from pounding Clemson early and then holding on for a 28-20 victory. It was a loss that Clemson fans didn't expect and there were plenty of reasons to feel that way. To this day many of the Tiger faithful still scratch their heads about that bowl game.

If you will recall that 2006 Clemson team scored 50+ points four times that season, at one time they were 8-1. And that loss was by a single point in double overtime. 2006 was the year of the night game against Georgia Tech when C.J. Spiller electrified the country and Clemson appeared to be back. 2006 started off with a blast, but the Tigers closed the regular season losing three of their final four games, landing them in Nashville, facing the Kentucky Wildcats.

Sound a little familiar?

After the loss in 2006, many fans felt like Clemson was flat and unmotivated. It looked like many of Clemson's players felt they had better things to do then play in the Music City Bowl. Let's hope there is a different ending to the season.

Being fired up about this game should not be an issue for Clemson. First and foremost this team kicked your tail the last time you played in this same game. Secondly, these seniors have never won a bowl game, NEVER. If I were Dabo Swinney, I would have Spiller speak to the group about how much a bowl win during his time at Clemson would mean to him. If that doesn't make those guys want to run through a wall, nothing will.

Personally, I haven't decided how I will predict this one just yet. I think we are in for an exciting game though. This should be a good matchup and I don't expect either team to run away with it.
