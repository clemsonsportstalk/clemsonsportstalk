In this week's episode we take a look at the new NCAA 2011 game by EA Sports. This year the game includes team entrances into their stadiums. This has been an area that Clemson fans have wanted added for years. That's right Tiger fans, you get to see the team run down the hill.

I thought the game play was slightly improved over last years game. Fortunately, Clemson was selected to be a featured team on the demo. Check out the attached video for an exclusive look at the Tiger's entrance.
