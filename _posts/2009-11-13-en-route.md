From "We Will Rock You" to DeAndre rocked you, Clemson's Death Valley was electric last Saturday night. After a slow start, Clemson took Florida State behind the woodshed in the second half and placed themselves in the drivers seat toward the ACC Championship game.

I'm putting an end to the talk, night games in Death Valley = **AWESOME!** Look at the last few played with the lights on and there is no comparison. Clemson should attempt to schedule at least two each season. Forget the drive, forget how late you might get home, Clemson's night atmosphere is one of the best in the country.

With the victory the Tigers now have a chance to secure a birth in the Atlantic Coast Conference championship game this weekend at N.C. State. A Clemson win, coupled with a Boston College loss and the Tigers will be in Tampa on December 5.

Most if not all Tiger fans would have taken this scenario if it was given to them in August. Win your last conference games against two less than stellar teams in North Carolina State (5-4, 1-4) and Virginia (3-6, 2-3) and you are in the title game.

Unlike seasons past, Clemson controls their route to the title; I dare not say "controls their own destiny". Put it this way, no one else needs to lose. The Tigers win and they are in. No questions.

Tom O'Brien and the Wolfpack will not roll over and just hand it to Clemson. I think that N.C. State will come out with their backs against the wall. They will give Clemson a good shot early, but Clemson will be playing with a sense of urgency that will push them all night long.

Knowing the title game is in the distance will not intimidate this team, it will inspire them. The coaching staff will not allow them to overlook N.C. State and will keep them focused on their preseason goals. From adjustments as big as those that occurred during the bye week between the Maryland and Wake games, or simply those made during halftimes throughout the year, this coaching staff has proven to me that they are ready to take us to the conference title game.

I fully expect Clemson to attack the Wolfpack on both sides of the ball. This is becoming a confident group. They seem hungry and I wouldn't want to be in between them and Tampa right now. I equate it to being a quarterback between DeAndre McDaniel and the end zone, get out of the way!

**Season Predictions: El Swann: 8-1 , Xbox 360: 8-1**
