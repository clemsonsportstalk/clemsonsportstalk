Clemson's C.J. Spiller talks about his final game at Clemson. It's going to be hard not to have C.J. on the team next year, but I am sure Clemson fans wish him the best in the NFL. In this video, Spiller makes some great comments about his feelings for the "Clemson Family".

Thank you C.J. for your hard work this season. I get the feeling our young players learned a lot from your example. It's fitting that no one will wear #28 again.
