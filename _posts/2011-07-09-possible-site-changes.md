As we close in on another great college football season, I wanted to gauge your interest on things I could do to improve the website. We currently push Clemson news 24 hours a day, seven days a week on our twitter feed. However, I don't get the number of site hits that I would like.

What ideas would you have for improving the site? Our site is very dynamic and changes throughout the day. Every podcast that is posted is updated on our site instantly. I hope you find that to be a nice feature.

Please let me know your ideas and I will see if we ca make things even better around here.
