I was listening to the radio the other day and heard a show talking about the combined SEC football and SEC basketball wins over the last five seasons. I was a bit surprised to find out that South Carolina ranked #11 overall in the SEC. Even when you factor in baseball the Gamecocks only move up to #9.

Hearing that, I thought it would be interesting to check out how the ACC fares as well. So I put the numbers together and ranked the teams based on the total number of wins. These numbers should be correct as of the time and date this was posted.

Where would you expect Clemson to finish in the ACC? I guess most of you would expect to find Clemson around #5 or #6 in combined sports. Read on to find out how the Tigers have done in recent seasons.

It's pretty interesting how it all boils down. I didn't take the liberty to add baseball, but I will try to put that together in the next few days.

What's your take on this information? I am proud of both Clemson programs, but until we win an ACC Championship in either sport these wins aren't worth very much.
