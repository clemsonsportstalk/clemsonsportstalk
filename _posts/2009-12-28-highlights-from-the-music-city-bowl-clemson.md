Here is the ESPN recap of Clemson's bowl victory. I thought Clemson played a good ballgame. There weren't a ton of spectacular plays, but the Tigers protected the ball which was huge. The future looks good for the Dabo Swinney era so far. I know it's only one season, but I saw a lot of good things from this very young coaching staff. It will be interesting to see how the 2010 season goes. I get the feeling expectations will once again be high in Tigertown.
