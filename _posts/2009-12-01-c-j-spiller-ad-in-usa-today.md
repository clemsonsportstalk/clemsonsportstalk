It looks like IPTAY purchased an ad to honor C.J. Spiller in today's USA Today. I think it's a classy move and well deserved. Whether he gets invited to New York for the Heisman trophy presentation or not, C.J Spiller has been pure class. I still contend that he is the best all around player in college football.

I don't know if it will help with his Heisman push, but it was a great gesture by IPTAY.
