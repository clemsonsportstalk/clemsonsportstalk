This year TigerNet Talk will have sponsors. These sponsors can have a 30 sec spot or a live read during the show. You can chose between 4 week or full season packages.

Your sponsorship will also include links to your company and logo in the show notes and post on TigerNet. Plus, your company will also have a link added on the front page of [Clemson Sports Talk](http://clemsonsportstalk.com) for the duration of your sponsorship. We really appreciate you supporting our program.

Those of you who are interested can email [clemson81@gmail.com](mailto:clemson81@gmail.com) for pricing and other questions.

The first episode of this season will be released on Thursday, August 26th. Thank you for your consideration.

Go Tigers!!
