***For this special, in-depth Clemson football season preview, we have invited
Ryan Kantor, a Clemson graduate ('11), to share his research and opinions. He
was the Sports Editor for a student newspaper at Clemson, and now writes for
[Sports-Kings.com][sports-kings] and [RyanKantor.com][preview-2013]. You can
tweet him at [@Ryan_Kantor][twitter].***

It's been a long and anxious wait for August 31st, but we're getting close.
[As I previously wrote][realistic], this is the most anticipated Clemson
football season in memory and expectations couldn't be higher. That's because
Tajh Boyd decided to return for his redshirt senior season, a decision that
vaulted him into [Heisman discussion][heisman] and Clemson into [National
Title hype][title-hype]. Superstar wide receiver, DeAndre Hopkins, was
drafted by the Houston Texans in the first round while senior running back
Andre Ellington was drafted by the Cardinals in the 6th, and [senior tight
end Brandon Ford signed with the New England Patriots][brandon-ford]. Despite
losing such major pieces, Clemson returns plenty of talent around quarterback
Tajh Boyd.

Sammy Watkins, Charone Peake, and Martavius Bryant provide dangerous deep
threats ([all three wide receivers ran a unofficial sub-4.30 40 yard
dash][clemson-wrs]), while Adam Humphries and redshirt freshman Gerome Hopper
can be above average in the slot.  Boyd said

> [I feel like I have the best receiving corps in the country][best-receivers]

Roderick "Hot Rod" McDowell, now a senior, will finally get a chance to start
at running back and will have plenty of depth behind him. More importantly,
he'll have plenty of experience in front of him as the O-line returns all but
Center Dalton Freeman.

The defense is certainly a bigger concern than the offense. They surrendered
24.8 points per game in 2012, good for just 48th. After seeing the unit "click"
in the Chick-fil-A Bowl, and now having a full year with Defensive Coordinator
Brent Venables, many believe they'll make strides this season. The secondary
was porous last year, and while both safeties (Rashard Hall and Jonathan Meeks)
are gone, Travis Blanks is shifting there full-time, bringing reason for
optimism. Additionally, a cornerback corps that struggled with injuries is
finally healthy.

Improved play up front will ease pressure on the secondary. The defensive line
lost just one player ([Malliciah Goodman, who was drafted by the Atlanta
Falcons][goodman]) and he is replaced by Vic Beasley who coaches have been
raving about for months. The more experienced line should help everyone behind
them. [The defensive front allowed an average of just 102 rushing yards in
their last six games, including only 99 from LSU][defensive-front].  They
should grow even tougher against the run, so it will be stopping opposing
passing attacks that poses the biggest weakness for the Clemson Tigers.

In a [June 30th article][realistic] regarding realistic expectations, I
mentioned that I would be using "victory likelihood percentages" rather than
randomly picking winners of the UGA and SC-Columbia games and throwing in an
upset. [I've used the (very) early spreads][beyond-the-bets]
([here][spreads]) and my own research to generate these percentages. Using a
1,000 season simulator created by [@Robert_Reinhard][reinhard], I've turned
these game-by-game percentages into final season predictions at the end of
article.

If you disagree with my percentages and would like to see your own percentages
run through the simulator please feel free to post your numbers in the comments
over at [RyanKantor.com][preview-2013] and I'll run your numbers through the
simulator. Now, on to the game-by-game analysis.

### Georgia

The rivalry is renewed as the Bulldogs make the 90 minute trip to Tiger Town
for the front-end of a home-and-home. The early line has the spread at 3.5
points in UGA's favor.

UGA has returned essentially all their starters on offense and [lost all but
four defense][georgia-defense], give or take.  [Their secondary is especially
thin, which bodes well for Clemson's vaunted aerial attack][georgia-secondary].
The Dawgs have suspended Josh Harvey-Clemons, who was set to be the starter at
safety ([UGA has the strictest drug policy in the SEC][drug-testing]). ESPN
calls it a ["huge blow."][huge-blow]  Additionally, two promising freshman
who were likely to get playing time against Clemson have suffered injuries and
will not play at all this season.

> [Paris Bostick, a freshman safety from Tampa,
> underwent surgery on his left big toe recently and will have to be medically
> redshirted... Bostick becomes the second true freshman defensive back to be
> lost for the year while recovering for surgery. Cornerback Reggie Wilkerson, an
> early enrollee who had worked himself into a backup role at boundary corner,
> suffered an ACL injury during voluntary workouts this summer and also will be
> redshirted][paris-bostick]

While their defense may be young and untested (likely to start just one
senior), they are not without talent, but it'll be a lot to ask this defense to
stop possibly the best offense in the country so early on in the season. In
fact, with Oregon suffering Chip Kelly's departure to the NFL, we may see the
two best offenses in the entire nation face off in the opening week. [No wonder
it's one of the 10 toughest tickets in all of college football this
season.][coaching-search]

UGA's offense returns the entire offensive line, possibly the best running back duo in the country, and an elite quarterback (36 TDs last season). This one has all the making of a shootout, yet it is likely to come down to defense. Both will be overwhelmed with the immensely talented offenses opposing them, however Clemson showed significant improvement down the stretch in 2012, most notably in their victory against LSU. With a College Gameday crowd behind them, the Clemson defense could step up and get just the couple stops needed to win. Clemson is fortunate to play UGA in week one, before their defense rounds into form and while at least one, <a title="UPI" href="http://www.upi.com/Sports_News/College-Football/2013/07/03/UGA-kicker-could-miss-games-for-drunk-boating-charge/UPI-47451372860989/" target="_blank"><strong>maybe more</strong></a>, Bulldogs are suspended. It's a complete toss up game, but at home, (slight) edge Tigers!

___Victory Likelihood: 51%___

### South Carolina State

Here's what you need to know about this FCS opponent. They had a losing record
last season. They visited Clemson in 2008 and took a 0-54 loss. This should be
an opportunity for Coach Swinney to get some reps for the second team. That
said, this is my favorite FCS opponent to play because their band is out of
this world. Absolutely, under no circumstance should you leave your seat at
halftime.

___Victory Likelihood: >99%___


### at North Carolina State (Thursday)

Much like UNC last season, which played nine games in the state of North
Carolina, the Wolfpack won't venture out-of-state until a October 26th trip to
Tallahassee, FL. Their only other out-of-state game will be at Boston College.
They play eight home games, one of which is a Thursday night game against
Clemson. Thursday night games pose a unique challenge for road teams, but
Clemson will benefit from a bye in the preceding week and should carry a huge
advantage heading into this one.

Dave Doeren enters his first season as the Wolfpack head coach after leading
Northern Illinois to an Orange Bowl appearance last year. [He'll implement a
spread offense][nc-state-spread-offense], but will be doing so with a new
quarterback as Mike Glennon is off the NFL. In fact, [they'll replace the
majority of their starters on each side of the ball][nc-state-starters] and
while they have the facilities and they believe the coach in place to build a
winner, it doesn't happen overnight.

The Wolfpack's surprise win over FSU showed they can't be taken lightly, but
even on a Thursday Night, Clemson should be able to collect a road win against
a program with a new coach, new system, and a bevy of new starters. On a
slightly more cheery note for Wolfpack reader, this year's cake walk schedule
is well-timed. With the transition underway, now is not the time for a
demanding schedule and [they certainly don't have one][nc-state-schedule]. They
could easily win eight games and still be a barely mediocre squad.

An interesting side note, the new Clemson Defensive Backs Coach, Mike Reed will
face his 2012 employer.

___Victory Likelihood: 86%___


### Wake Forest
Wake Forest enters the 2013 campaign with bowl aspirations. The Deacons
finished just 5-7 last season ([including a 13-42 home loss to
Clemson][wf-game]), but return eight starters on offense and seven starters on
defense.

One of those returning starters is 4th year QB, Tanner Price, who will have the
benefit of more consistent and experienced line play. The offensive line was
certainly a weakness for the Deacs last season, and improvement of the line
will be critical for success. In the passing game, it will be all Michael
Campanaro all the time. Campanaro led the ACC in receptions/game at 7.9, which
was 1.4 more than any other receiver.

The defense finished 6th in the ACC last year in points allowed per game and
return star nose tackle and member of the Bednarik Award Watch List, Nikita
Whitlock. Additionally, the secondary should be solid as former ACC Defensive
Rookie of the Year, Merrill Noel is expected to bounce back with a great junior
season, and Kevin Johnson looks to build on his strong sophomore season.
Redshirt freshman Ryan Janvion should make an impact at safety.

This Wake Forest team will be much improved from last season and should make a
bowl game. Despite all these reasons for optimism it'll be hard to compete with
the Tigers in Death Valley. The Tigers are simply too explosive on offense.
Don't expect the Deacons to roll over as they did last season, but don't bank
on an upset either.

Dear][bloggersodear]._

___Victory Likelihood: 94%___


### at Syracuse

Syracuse joins the ACC Atlantic this season after escaping the Big East, but
they'll mostly contribute merely by their proximity to a large media market.
Their first season in the conference will also be their first under head coach
[Scott Schafer][scott-schafer] (previously the defensive coordinator). Doug
Marrone has departed to coach the Buffalo Bills and has brought seven coaches
with him. Star quarterback, Ryan Nassib, along with his top two receivers have
departed. [Phil Steele did not project the Orange to make a bowl game in his
annual season preview][phil-steele].

It will be a long trip and a new venue for Clemson which is unsettling. Still,
playing in a dome should be no problem (ask LSU) and the extra two days of rest
and practice after a Thursday night game in Raleigh are a bonus. There's
absolutely no reason Clemson should lose to a 5 or 6 win team.

___Victory Likelihood 89%___


### Boston College

In 2012, the Eagles actually gave Clemson a bit of a scare in Chestnut Hill,
sticking around for most of the game and scoring 31 points. Overall though,
Boston College had yet another poor year amidst an ugly four-year program
decline. [They finished 2-10 and fired Head Coach Frank Spaziani (this
hyperlinked article on that firing and culture of the area may make you wish BC
was never invited to the ACC)][frank-spaziani]. Although [Steve Addazio, an
Urban Meyer disciple][stever-addazio], was hired away from Temple, Vegas has
the over/under for BC's regular season wins at just 4.5.

The Eagles return a fairly solid senior quarterback in Chase Rettig, however
he'll stand behind a shaky offensive line and has little in the way of
offensive weapons--certainly nothing like Sammy Watkins (or [Charone
Peake][charone-peake] for that matter). On defense, the Eagles again boast
strong linebackers which seems to be the hallmark of the program, but their
secondary, is particularly weak ([in-depth BC Football preview
here][bc-preview]). Tajh Boyd should have a field day in this favorable
matchup.

Clemson will be at home concluding the easiest stretch of their schedule (Wake,
@Syracuse, BC). So long as they don't look past this matchup in anticipation of
FSU, who comes to town the following week, this won't be close.

__Fun Fact__: BC plays a road game at New Mexico State this season. Why are
they in the ACC again?

___Victory Likelihood: 98%___

### Florida State

The Seminoles have lost a lot coming into this season, however they've rebuilt
the program to the point where expectations remain high regardless. That's a
big step back to prominence, but to meet expectations this season they'll have
to overcome the [loss of six assistant coaches][fsu-assistant-coaches], QB EJ
Manuel, and seven NFL picks just on the defensive side of the ball. That
includes the 24th pick of the draft DE Bjoern Werner (led the ACC with 13
sacks) and the 25th pick DB Xavier Rhodes.

The defense will be led by first time defensive coordinator Jeremy Pruitt who
was the defensive backs coach under Saban at Alabama. He'll take over a unit
that led the ACC with 36 sacks (Clemson had 34). The biggest difference from
last year will be the front seven where FSU was so dominant last season. Three
defensive linemen and three linebackers were drafted away. Mario Edwards Jr. a
rising sophomore defensive end is very talented and was the number one
defensive recruit out of high school. He seems primed to lead the Seminole pass
rush. With all the talent FSU has been stockpiling throughout the recruiting
process they'll have plenty of depth to replace the NFL departures, however
they will no longer look like the New York Giants.

On the offensive side of the ball, EJ Manuel is off to the Buffalo Bills and
Clint Trickett, who started and played a great game in Death Valley in 2011,
[transferred to West Virginia][clint-trickett]. The Seminoles turn to redshirt
freshman quarterback Jameis Winston. He was a very highly touted recruit and
expectations are sky-high, but [he was born in... ___1994!___][jameis-winston]
How old does that make him, like 11? Maybe I'm getting old, but how in the
world is this offense going to do what they did last year with an 18-year-old
at the helm (FSU finished 2012 3rd in yards per play)?

One thing I don't like about this matchup is that FSU enjoys a bye the week
prior. Still, with the coaching turnover, an unbelievable amount of talent to
replace after an impressive Miami Hurricanes type of NFL draft, and an
18-year-old at quarterback I'm not picking the Seminoles to repeat as ACC
Champions or Atlantic winners. What makes me most confident though, is the fact
that they've lost their last five games in Death Valley. This may not be the
best FSU team that has traveled to Death Valley in that decade, but it will be
the best Clemson Tiger team they've faced. I'm giving the Tigers a bold and
confident...

___Victory Likelihood: 67%___

### at Maryland

When Maryland fired Ralph Friedgen, a quality coach who had just won nine
games, we were left to wonder "who do you think you are?" Maryland is
basketball school with a failing athletic department, failing so bad they had
to move to a far off conference for extra cash. After that 9-win 2010 season,
the Terrapins opted for the bold move brought in Randy Edsall from UConn. A
splashy hire that hasn't worked so far, as they've netted just six wins over
the last two season.

Last season can largely be written off to a ridiculous bevy of injuries, [but
Edsall, despite my support][randy-edsall], will find himself on the hot seat if
Maryland's ACC swan song doesn't end in a bowl game.  The Terrapins should
improve and will boast one of the nation's more electrifying receivers in
Stefon Diggs. They'll have an actual quarterback (rather than a linebacker, as
was necessitated by injury) throwing to him as CJ Brown, the speedy quarterback
who gave us fits in our last visit to College Park should be back and healthy.
It's likely their offense will improve quite a bit and it could aggravate the
Clemson D, but they also return just five starters on defense.

Although I'm not at all sad to see Maryland leave the conference, and get
replaced by Louisville ([who will be an upgrade in all three major
sports][louisville]) this is a road trip I am anxious to make. It'll be our
last chance to see Clemson play against this ACC charter member, and should be
a defense Tajh can roll right through, barring a Seminole hangover.

___Victory Probability: 82%___

![CJ Brown ran wild, but Sammy Watkins led a wild comeback in 2011.](http://cdn3.sbnation.com/entry_photo_images/4077356/129319729_extra_large.jpg)

### at Virginia

I can't claim I ever thought Mike London would be a bust. [In fact, I called
the strong 2011 season and figured the program would grow from
there][charlottesville]. After the 2011 Chick-fil-A Bowl appearance, the
Cavaliers finished just 4-8 last season. This offseason they added former NC
State head coach, Tom O'Brien, to the staff as an assistant.  They'll have a
veteran offensive line and should improve, but eclipsing .500 may be a
challenge as they will play BYU, Oregon, Clemson, @Miami, @UNC, and VT.

Clemson was once considered "soft" and "finesse." That label is being shed, and
nobody owns it more than UVA, as Cowherd explains in excruitiating detail below
(must watch). Clemson will beat these "underachieving, cookie dough,
ascot-wearing, bran muffin eatin' weenies."

"You're no threat in big college football." - Colin Cowherd

___Victory Probability: 89%___

### Georgia Tech (Thursday)

This year's game will be in Clemson for the second consecutive year. Adding to
the quirkiness, [Clemson University will have to handle the traffic and
headaches of hosting a Thursday Night ESPN game][thursday-game]. The Tigers
haven't hosted a Thursday night game since 2002, typically getting stuck
playing them on the road.

When Georgia Tech asked to play Clemson in Death Valley a second year in a row
([a move that allows them to host either Clemson or UGA every year and ensure
themselves at least one home sellout][johnson-jackets]) the Tigers caught a big
break. Not only does it make sense in the long run (Louisville/SC-Columbia at
home on even numbered years, GT/FSU on odd numbered years), but it makes a big
difference in Clemson's chances at improving on their 10-win regular season
from a year ago.

The Tigers went 1-4 against GT in my four years as a student (2007-2011)
including 0-4 away from Death Valley. GT head coach Paul Johnson will hope to
rekindle that magic. In 2008 and 2009 he led the Jackets to a 5-2 record
against Clemson, VT, and UGA--since then just 1-8.

Both squads enter the game coming off a bye week and both will need it. Clemson
must to prepare for a gimmick offense and a Yellow Jacket team that returns
seven players on offense and eight on defense. The Jackets, playing a road
weekday game, need it to counter the disadvantage of losing a day for travel on
a short week. The ACC has done a good giving bye weeks before Thursday Night
ESPN games as of late.

GT is excited to begin the [Vad Lee][vad-lee] era. The talented Sophomore takes
over at quarterback and will run the triple option behind [four returning
O-linemen][gt-linemen]. More importantly, the awful defense should improve as
they return eight starters and fully implement the [4-3 with new defensive
coordinator Ted Roof, who took over after Al
Groh](http://cfn.scout.com/2/1303503.html) was [fired][fired].

Georgia Tech is always tricky and I see them improving a bit (from 6-6 regular
season) to seven or eight regular season wins. The Sun Bowl victory over the
Trojans, Vad Lee, and an improving defense are reasons to worry. Nonetheless,
at home, following a bye, Clemson should take care of business.

___Victory Likelihood: 80%___

### The Citadel

[Kent State was originally scheduled in this slot, but ACC Commissioner, John
Swofford spoiled that with his waffling between an eight-game and a nine-game
conference schedule][2013-schedule]. When he moved the conference to the
nine-game schedule, the Tigers were forced to drop Kent State from their 2013
schedule (and Central Michigan from the 2014 slate). When they (rightly) moved
back to the eight-game schedule Clemson scrambled and had to settle on a second
in-state, FCS program.

The Citadel Bulldogs (yes the third Bulldogs on the schedule along with UGA and
South Carolina State), finished 7-4 (5-3) in the FCS's premier conference--the
Southern Conference--in 2012. They're certainly better than South Carolina
State, but they'll be heavily over-matched at virtually every position. The
slot right before a trip to Columbia makes this a bit of a trap game, but it
shouldn't matter. This is the least interesting game on the schedule.

___Victory Likelihood: >99%___

### at South Carolina, Columbia Campus

South Carolina [lost their biggest play maker on offense][usc-offense], Ace
Sanders, and [their top five linebackers from a year ago][usc-linebackers].
They'll have to rely on James Davis's little brother, Mike, at running back.
With such obstacles, the Cocks will be hard pressed to live up [the pre-season
top 5 hype][usc-rank], but in their favor is a soft schedule that looks quite a
bit like the ones Spurrier complained about UGA getting the past two seasons.
They face Florida at home and get an easy draw from the West playing neither
LSU nor Alabama (Miss St.  and Arkansas instead).

The [majority of the Gamecock starters on defense][usc-defense] have left and
while they still have Clowney, it will be a lot to replace. Still, expectations
are sky high. [Sports Nation calls it the "Clowney Effect." The answer to any
serious deficiency, "Jadeveon Clowney."][clowney-effect]

While the Cocks may be a little weaker than in the past two seasons, it's no
coincidence that they've beat Clemson four in a row. Their offense has been
quietly effective, overcoming injuries at quarterback and running back to win
in Death Valley last season and their defense is overwhelming. They recorded
six sacks against Clemson last November with Clowney earning 4.5 of them.

Given a relatively favorable schedule leading up to Rivalry Week, it's likely
the Gamecocks will already have 9 or 10 wins before hosting a Clemson Tiger
team with as many or even more wins. That should make for one of the biggest
games ever played in Williams-Brice. [Clowney made some arrogant clown comments
when he said that SEC quarterbacks and Tajh Boyd are scared of
him][clowney-boyd]. This only adds to the animosity.

___Victory Likelihood 49%___

### The Simulator

Now, to turn to the simulator for the synopsis. There are three games that are
going to be challenging with victory likelihoods of just 49%, 51%, and 67%. The
chance of sweeping these three opponents (Columbia, Georgia, and FSU,
respectively) is just 17%. I believe we'll split against UGA and Columbia and
defeat the Seminoles.

___Chance of 8 wins or less: 12%___

___Chance of 9 wins: 21%___

___Chance of 10 wins: 34%___

___Chance of (any) 11 wins: 26%___

___Chance of entering Columbia undefeated (11-0): 14%___

___Chance of leaving Columbia Undefeated (12-0): 7%___

___Chance of perfect (8-0) ACC record: 28%___

The most likely scenario is a strong 10-2 regular season. Assuming one of those
10 wins comes against FSU, the Tigers will make a trip to Charlotte to play for
the ACC Championship. My prediction, and now we're really reaching projecting
this far ahead, would be a matchup against Miami. If that's the case, it'll be
a tremendous showcase for the conference.

I'd set the over/under for Clemson's regular season win total at 10. If you
forced me to pick, I'd **take
the over**.

I close with only one caveat. There's no way to consider potential injuries or
suspensions that may occur in the future. Should Tajh Boyd (God forbid) miss
any time our chances of winning dramatically decreases. Conversely, if a player
like Jadeveon Clowney is out when we square off, our chances improve. There's
no way to incorporate such random events into the projections so they have not
been considered, nor will these projections be edited on the fly to account for
such eventualities.
