Clemson's DeAndre McDaniel seems to be smiling before leveling Christian Ponder on a late game interception return. Ponder was injured on the play and his status for the remaining games doesn't look good right now.

The Clemson Tiger defense was superb all night forcing the Seminoles into 5 turnovers, 4 of which were interceptions. Cemson's McDaniel continues to be a force in the secondary.
